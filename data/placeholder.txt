# Data Directory

This directory is for storing data files such as:
- Molecule structure data
- Target protein information
- Property prediction models
- SMILES libraries
- Substructure templates

For the current MVP version, all data is stored directly in the xeno_app.py file for simplicity.
However, as the project evolves, external data files can be placed here to:
- Separate data from code
- Make the application more maintainable
- Allow for easier updates to molecule and target data
- Support loading real molecular data sources in the future
