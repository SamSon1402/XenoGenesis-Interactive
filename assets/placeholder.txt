# Assets Directory

This directory is for storing static assets such as:
- Molecular structure images
- Icons and symbols
- Font files (if needed locally)
- CSS files (if separated from main app)
- Any other static resources

Note: For the MVP version, all styling is included directly in the xeno_app.py file,
but this directory can be used to store external assets if the project expands.
